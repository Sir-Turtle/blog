# README

I'm developing this web application to use as my personal blog, or at least that's the initial plan. I will write about books I'm reading, topics I'm studying, events I'm attending and/or volunteering for such as Ladies Learning Code, places I travel to, and other causes I want to spread awareness about like people with disabilities/mental health/minorities in need of help, etc.

Environment details:
* Ruby version: 2.4.0p0
* Rails version: 5.0.2

Dependencies:
* psql version: 9.6.1
